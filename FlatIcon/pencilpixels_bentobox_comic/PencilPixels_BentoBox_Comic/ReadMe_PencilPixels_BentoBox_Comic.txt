Free Pencil Pixels BentoBox Comic Panel
One click Photoshop scripting effects that are easy to use as actions.

This Free Script has no watermark and no timeout period, but are restricted to 440x440 pixels. If your image is smaller than 440 pixels, a gray border will be added. If the image is larger, it will crop in to 440 pixels.

This effect works best with a wide variety of images from portraits to landscapes and when the subject is prominent and the background is not distracting.

Our scripts work on Photoshop CS through CS6, and CC on Mac and Windows. No additional plugins required. 

Like any plug-in or action from any company, images that are blurred, contain a lot of image noise, are overly compressed or are very dark and extremely low in contrast, will yield poor results. Keep that in mind.PencilPixels One-Click Scripts, Actions and Styles Use and Download Agreement Terms:   * The distribution, resale, reverse engineering, layer emulation or derivative development from the copyrighted products of Pencil Pixels is strictly prohibited.
